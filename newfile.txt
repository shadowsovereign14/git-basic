I am learning Git commands and its usage. Currently doing the practice exercises.
I created a new text file named newfile.txt and now I am going to update its content.
Updated this newfile.txt in the github repository.


## Practice Output 
1. Your repo url in Github
    https://github.com/shadowsovereign14/git-basic

2. Your answer for What is the difference between `add`, `commit`, and `push`?

git add - it will staged the chosen changed files to be included in git source control as a change to be committed

git commit - will keep track and log the changes made in every file from the remote repository

git push - will push the committed changes to the remote repository, and update the repository in reference to the latest commit(s)
